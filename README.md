Work in progress for the hand-knitting program

Here are some cats made with the program so far:

It needs some work. Things to improve:
* add sliders to change resolution based on yarn or sample size
* add capabilites to draw and repeat patternes more like faire isle knitting
* lots of testing
* better intreface / app for phone for hand knitting (animation the line you are on perhaps)
